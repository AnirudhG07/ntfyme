# ntfyme_key

For security reasons, `ntfyme` would like to secure your sensitive information like passwords. For this, `ntfyme` uses a universal one key which you will have to provide everytime you are asked by `ntfyme`. (Currently only when using gmail)

## Usage

This key is made by you which the code will use to decrypt your gmail app password and use it to send mails. This key is not stored anywhere in the code/by the code.
It is stored ONLY IN YOUR HEAD or wherever you decide to store it.

## Oops! I forgot my key

Don't worry, I got your back! Simply run the `ntfyme --interactive-setup` or in short `ntfyme -i` command to reset your details with your new key. This will overwrite your previous details.

Please be mindful of the use and do not share this key with anyone. Providing this key to anyone will not be taken as a responsibility of the repository owner.
