# Gmail Setup

This walkthrough will guide you through setting up your Gmail to get mails from `ntfyme`.

But before we start, I will make the below claims for any security related concerns:

1. No form of mailing is done to any other email address other than the one you provide. You will mail yourself ONLY.
2. Your email address, app password and any other sensitive information is not shared with any third party.
3. The code is open source and you can verify the code to see that it does not do anything malicious.
4. The code is run on your local machine and does not send any data to any other server.
5. Your `ntfyme_key` is not stored ANYWHERE in the code/by the code. You will have to provide it everytime you run with gmail enabled.

# ntfyme_key

Now let's discuss about usage of `ntfyme_key`. This key is made by you which the code will use to decrypt your gmail app password and use it to send mails. This key is not stored anywhere in the code/by the code.

If you forget this key, no need to worry. Simply run the `ntfyme --interactive-setup` or in short `ntfyme -i` command to reset your details with your new key. This will overwrite your previous details. Please be mindful of the use and do not share this key with anyone. Providing this key to anyone will not be taken as a responsibility of the repository owner.

# Let's Start

To setup your gmail, you will need to configure your gmail security settings to allow apps to send mails. This is a one time setup and you will not have to do this again.

## Step 1: Open Web Browser

## Step 3: Enable Two Factor Authorization
Scroll down and enable two factor authorization.

<br>

Turn on 2 factor authorization and Give your authentication passkeys which the google asks for.

## Step 4: Enabling App Password

Come Back to the Security Page and search `app password` in search bar.

<br>

Now, simply write your app name to anything like `ntfyme_bot` or anything you wish.

<br>

Now copy the app password you are given. Save this APP PASSWORD since you will be required to give this password to setup the GMAIL with ntfyme.

## Step 5: Configuring ntfyme
Run the command -
```bash
ntfyme -i
```
Enter `1` for gmail setup. Enter your gmail id as well as your APP PASSWORD you got.
**NOTE:** It is recommended to not remove the spaces between them, if you do then remember to remove it again next time you configure GMAIL again.

Enter the `ntfyme_key` which you have to think and make it yourself. And you are DONE!

Congratulations, you should be able to get email from ntfyme.
